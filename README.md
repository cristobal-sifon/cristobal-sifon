I am an Assistant Professor at the [Physics Institute](https://fis.ucv.cl) at [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Valpara√≠so](http://pucv.cl/). My research focuses on galaxy clusters, taking advantage of the intersection between optical and CMB surveys to study them using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and weak gravitational lensing. I am also interested in the evolution of cluster galaxies, particularly their dark matter content, and in the intrinsic alignment of galaxies. 

Latest Research
===============

* In [**Madhavacheril, Sif√≥n, Battaglia, et al.**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07772), we used data from ACT to measure the average mass of distant galaxy clusters from the MaDCoWS survey using the gravitational lensing effect imprinted on the CMB.
* In [**Hilton, Sif√≥n, et al.**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11043) we present the latest galaxy cluster catalog selected with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, thanks to large overlap with all major optical-NIR surveys. The catalog contains 4,200 galaxy clusters, of which 868 are new. This sample is twice as large as the total number of SZ-selected clusters prior to it!
