I am an Assistant Professor at the [Physics Institute](https://fis.ucv.cl) at [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Valpara√≠so](http://pucv.cl/). My research focuses on galaxy clusters, taking advantage of the intersection between optical and CMB surveys to study them using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and weak gravitational lensing. I am also interested in the evolution of cluster galaxies, particularly their dark matter content, and in the intrinsic alignment of galaxies. 

Latest Research
===============

* In [**Madhavacheril, Sif√≥n, Battaglia, et al. (2021)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07772), we used data from ACT to measure the average mass of distant galaxy clusters from the MaDCoWS survey using the gravitational lensing effect imprinted on the CMB.
* In [**Hilton, Sif√≥n, et al. (2021)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11043) we present the latest galaxy cluster catalog selected with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, thanks to large overlap with all major optical-NIR surveys. The catalog contains 4,200 galaxy clusters, of which 868 are new. This sample is twice as large as the total number of SZ-selected clusters prior to it!
* In [**Herbonnet, Sif√≥n, et al. (2020)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04414), we use weak gravitational lensing to accurately measure the masses of 100 massive galaxy clusters, aided with extensive image simulations, in order to improve our ability to use galaxy clusters as cosmological probes.
* In [**Sif√≥n et al. (2018b)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06125) we studied the impact of galaxy clusters on the mass content of their member galaxies using detailed weak gravitational lensing measurements.
* In [**Sif√≥n et al. (2018a)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07847) we presented the first measurement of the average mass of "ultra-diffuse galaxies": large, diffuse galaxies that, unexpectedly, abound in massive galaxy clusters.
