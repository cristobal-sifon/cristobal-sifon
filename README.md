I am an Assistant Professor at the [Physics Institute](https://fis.ucv.cl) at [Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de ValparaÃ­so](http://pucv.cl/). My research focuses on galaxy clusters, taking advantage of the intersection between optical and CMB surveys to study them using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and weak gravitational lensing. I am also interested in the evolution of cluster galaxies, particularly their dark matter content, and in the intrinsic alignment of galaxies. My full list of publications is in [ADS](https://goo.gl/LAu9G4). You can also take a look at my [CV](https://github.com/cristobal-sifon/cv/blob/master/Sifon_CV.pdf) if you want.
